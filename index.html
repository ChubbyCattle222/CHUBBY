        "Chubby Cattle is so unique because of their bold willingness to innovate. The arcade machines made me feel nostalgic with their collection of classic video games. Our server Chris went over the menu and the layout of the restaurant. He explained that this is their flagship location and offers features like the arcade, sterilized eggs, and self-serve drinks near Chubby Tea. Chris asked if we had allergies or were celebrating anything. He cooked all the meats perfectly and paired them with the best sauces. The 90-minute dining limit felt just right, and the ice cream flavors like Taro and Matcha were a perfect way to end the meal. Chris truly provided top-tier service. Be sure to ask for Chris if you visit for an unforgettable experience!",
        "This restaurant stands out for its creativity and innovation. The arcade games were a fun way to pass time while waiting. Chris, our server, explained the menu thoroughly and highlighted special features like the sterilized eggs, arcade, and self-serve drinks at Chubby Tea. He also asked about allergies and special occasions. Chris cooked each cut of meat exactly to perfection and recommended excellent sauces. The dining time of 90 minutes seemed short at first, but it was plenty for the rich and flavorful meats. Their soft-serve ice cream flavors, like Sea Salt and Vanilla, are absolutely worth trying! The clean restrooms were also impressive. Chris’s service was beyond amazing—don’t miss out on asking for him when you visit!",
        "Chubby Cattle is one of a kind because of their innovative touches. The arcade games kept me entertained and brought back memories. Chris, our server, walked us through the menu and described the standout features, like the arcade, the sterilized eggs, and the Chubby Tea drink station. He also asked about any dietary restrictions or celebrations. Chris cooked all of our meats with care and recommended sauces that matched perfectly. The 90-minute time limit worked well, and I made room for their delicious ice creams despite being full. The clean and well-maintained restrooms left a great impression. Chris’s excellent service made the experience unforgettable.",

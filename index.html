        "Chubby Cattle is so unique because of their bold willingness to innovate. Their collection of classic video games brought back nostalgic memories. Our server Chris went over the menu and the layout of the restaurant. He explained that this is their flagship location and offers features like sterilized eggs and self serve drinks near Chubby Tea. Chris asked if we had allergies or were celebrating anything. He cooked all the meats perfectly and paired them with the best sauces. The 90 minute dining limit felt just right, and the ice cream flavors like Taro and Matcha were a perfect way to end the meal. Chris truly provided top tier service. Be sure to ask for Chris if you visit for an unforgettable experience.",

The standout features like the Chubby Tea self serve drink station created a lively and fun vibe. Every dish Chris prepared was flawless, and the sauces he suggested complemented the meats beautifully.
